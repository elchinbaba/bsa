                a connected core technology stack and start-up functionality that makes it possible to see how all parts of the project work.
                It will be necessary to understand the existing code and refine the functionality. We have prepared a list of tasks for execution: some are aimed at
                to complement or extend existing functionality, others to implement it from scratch.</div></div><div class="rule"><span class="rule-index">02</span><div class="rule-title">What does the mini-project give</div><div class="rule-content">
                    <p>
                        We introduced a mini-project 2 years ago, and according to students feedback, it turned out to be extremely useful both for further work on homework from lectures,
                        and for the development of projects of the Academy. Having dealt with the mini-project, you will understand how the project should be built from the inside, what the architecture looks like,
                        what the standard looks like, which must be adhered to during the development of a project at the Academy, how the technologies work, which we will get acquainted with later at the Academy.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can read more about the mini-project in <a target="_blank" href="https://academy.binary-studio.com/blog/mini-proekt-bonusnii-etap-kademiyi">an article on our blog</a></p>

                    <p>
                        We understand that it can be difficult to work with a mini-project without experience, so we decided that <b>the grade for a mini-project will not affect admission to the Academy</b>.
                        BUT the very fact of completing a mini-project can have a positive effect on the chances of being enrolled. We emphasize that the mini-project is not a selection, it is part of the learning process,
                        one might even say a bonus for those who made it to the finish line of the selection. :) We are sure that absolutely everyone benefits from it,
                        so we encourage you to complete as many tasks from the mini-project as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The result of working on a mini-project is determined by how deeply you were able to understand the project.
                        The quantity and quality of completed tasks will be checked. The task will be considered ready if it is fully completed and the feature works.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Verification of mini-projects will take some time, because the process is not automated. You can get up to 10 points for working on it,
                        and it will be regarded as one of the lectures of the theoretical stage of the Academy (not selection lectures, but those that will begin in July, for students
                        enrolled in the Academy).
